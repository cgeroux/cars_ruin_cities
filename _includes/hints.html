        <h1 class="title">Better cities are possible</h1>
        
        <p class="has-text-left">These podcasts and youtube channels helped me to understand the role walking, cycling and public transit can play in improving our cities, from noise and air pollution to even making them better places to drive by reducing traffic on the roads. My favourite was <i>Not Just Bikes</i> as it gave great examples of how cities can be better and I enjoyed how easy the information was to digest. Some of the videos I found the most interesting were based on work by <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/">strongtowns.org</a>. Strong towns also has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTeYrzSQ3YCp3RovGH4y8Ew">youtube channel</a> and a <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/podcast">podcast</a>.</p>
